# cpp-flashgrams
C++ programs tiny enough to fit on an Anki flashcard.

## Quickstart

Navigate to any `main.cpp` program here, and run

```bash
g++ main.cpp
```

Then run `a.out` to see what happens.

Finally, screenshot the program *and* the output and ask yourself if you understand what's happening. Or image occlude parts you aren't sure of and fill in the blanks. The world is your oyster!

## Motivation

My darling wife was taking a C++ course in school and I wanted to help her. Also, the company next door to mine was hiring for a senior C++ developer, but I was pretty bad at it.
