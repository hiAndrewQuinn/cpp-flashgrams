# cpp-flashgrams
C++ programs tiny enough to fit on an Anki flashcard.

## Quickstart

Navigate to any `main.cpp` program here, and run

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out
```

Then what happens.

Finally, screenshot the program *and* the output and put it into Anki. Ask yourself if you understand what's happening. Or image occlude parts you aren't sure of and fill in the blanks. The world is your oyster!

## Motivation

My darling wife was taking a C++ course in school and I wanted to help her. Also, the company next door to mine was hiring for a senior C++ developer, but I was pretty bad at it.
